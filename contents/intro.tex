% Purpose: Motivate the need of an autonomous back-in parking system.


Mobility impairment is a big problem in older adults. Mobility is pivotal to the
quality of life of residents in long-term care facilities, offering a means of
freedom, choice and independence \cite{bourret2002meaning}.
This lack of mobility leads to social, psychological and physical problems.

% The potential impact for smart wheelchairs is significant.
One method in aiding mobility is using powered wheelchairs with additional smart
capabilities.
An estimated 1.4 million to 2.1 million individuals in the US in 2008 stood to
benefit from smart wheelchairs, and an estimated 973 thousand to 1.7 million of
those stood to benefit from autonomous navigation capabilities in particular.
These estimates are expected to grow proportional to the increase in
wheelchair users, which grows at a rate of 5.9 percent per year
\cite{simpson2008many}.

% Smart wheelchairs are needed.
However, it may be impossible persons with severe disabilities to maneouver PWCs
given their current control interfaces: 10\% of patients who receive PWC traning
find it extremely difficult or impossible to use the whelchair for activities of
daily living \cite{fehr2000adequacy}.
Moreso, when asked specifically about steering and maneuvering tasks, the
percentage of patients reported to find these difficult or impossible jumped to
40, and  nearly half of patients unable to control a power wheelchair by
conventional methods would benefit from an automated navigation system,
according to the clinicians who treat them. 
Due to this, Fehr et al. \cite{fehr2000adequacy} concludes supervised autonomous
navigation is necessary over more innovative steering interfaces.

However, total autonomy is hard and may not even be desired. 
A totally autonomous system may deprive user's feeling of being in control 
\cite{viswanathana2014wizard}.
Older adults preferred robot assistance over human assistance for tasks related
to chores, manipulating objects, and information management, but not personal
care and leisure activities \cite{smarr2014domestic}.
Instead, systems that complete specific chore-like tasks akin to automatic
parallel parking or cruise control on a car is more suitable.

Some work has been done on task-specific autonomous PWC behaviours, including
navigation in crowded environments \cite{prassler2001robotics}, obstacle
avoidance \cite{viswanathan2012navigation}, and docking onto lift platforms
\cite{sermeno2006vision} and custom-designed beds \cite{ren2012docking}.

More general overviews of smart wheelchair systems can be found in
\cite{viswanathan2012navigation, simpson2005smart, faria2013patient} (TODO
confirm).

Little work has been done to dock/back-in park a wheelchair in a more general
environment, such a general indoor office environment akin to a room in a
long-term care facility.
