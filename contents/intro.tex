% Purpose: Motivate the need of an autonomous back-in parking system.

Mobility impairment is a big problem.
Lack of mobility leads to social, psychological and physical problems.
Powered wheelchairs can improve mobility for those unable to use manual wheelchairs.

% The potential impact for smart wheelchairs is significant.
An estimated 1.4 million to 2.1 million individuals in the US in 2008 stood to
benefit from smart wheelchairs, and an estimated 973 thousand to 1.7 million of
those stood to benefit from autonomous navigation capabilities in particular.
These estimates are expected to grow proportional to the increase in
wheelchair users, which grows at a rate of 5.9 percent per year
\cite{simpson2008many}.

% Smart wheelchairs are needed.
However, it may be impossible persons with severe disabilities to maneouver PWCs
given their current control interfaces: 10\% of patients who receive PWC traning
find it extremely difficult or impossible to use the whelchair for activities of
daily living \cite{fehr2000adequacy}.

Moreso, when asked specifically about steering and maneuvering tasks, the
percentage of patients reported to find these difficult or impossible jumped to
40, and  nearly half of patients unable to control a power wheelchair by
conventional methods would benefit from an automated navigation system,
according to the clinicians who treat them. 
Due to this, Fehr et al. \cite{fehr2000adequacy} concludes supervised autonomous
navigation is necessary over more innovative steering interfaces.

% However, total autonomy is hard and even detrimental.
% A system that completes specific hard tasks, akin to automatic parallel
% parking or cruise control on a car, is preferred.
