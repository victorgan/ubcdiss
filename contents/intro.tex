% Purpose: Motivate the need of an autonomous back-in parking system.

% Lack of mobility leads to social, psychological and physical problems.
Mobility impairment is a significant problem for older adults. Mobility is
shown to be pivotal to the quality of life of residents in long-term care
facilities, offering a means of freedom, choice and independence
\cite{bourret2002meaning}.

% The potential impact for smart wheelchairs is significant.
Smart wheelchairs have a large potential for impact.
One method in aiding mobility is using powered wheelchairs with additional smart
capabilities.
An estimated 1.4 million to 2.1 million individuals in the US in 2008 stood to
benefit from smart wheelchairs, and an estimated 973 thousand to 1.7 million of
those stood to benefit from autonomous navigation capabilities in particular.
These estimates are expected to grow proportional to the increase in
wheelchair users, which grows at a rate of 5.9 percent per year
\cite{simpson2008many}.

% Smart wheelchairs are needed.
However, it may be impossible for persons with severe disabilities to maneuver PWCs
given their current control interfaces: 10\% of patients who receive PWC training
find it extremely difficult or impossible to use the wheelchair for activities of
daily living \cite{fehr2000adequacy}.
Moreso, when asked specifically about steering and maneuvering tasks, the
percentage of patients reported to find these difficult or impossible jumped to
40\%, and nearly half of patients unable to control a power wheelchair by
conventional methods would benefit from an automated navigation system.
Due to this, Fehr et al. \cite{fehr2000adequacy} concludes supervised autonomous
navigation is necessary over improved steering interfaces.

% Semi-automation is the way to go
Though autonomous tasks are necessary, total autonomy is hard and may not even be desired. 
A totally autonomous system may deprive user's feeling of being in control 
\cite{viswanathana2014wizard}.
Older adults preferred robot assistance over human assistance for tasks related
to chores, manipulating objects, and information management, but not personal
care and leisure activities \cite{smarr2014domestic}.
Instead, systems that complete specific chore-like tasks akin to automatic
parallel parking or cruise control on a car is more suitable.

% There has been some progress on semi-automation
This leads to the need of task-specific autonomous behaviours.
Some work has been done on task-specific autonomous PWC behaviours, including
navigation in crowded environments \cite{prassler2001robotics}, obstacle
avoidance \cite{viswanathan2012navigation}, and docking onto lift platforms
\cite{sermeno2006vision} and custom-designed beds \cite{ren2012docking}.
More general overviews of smart wheelchair systems can be found in
\cite{viswanathan2012navigation, simpson2005smart, faria2013patient} (TODO
confirm).

% Not much in general back-in parking, a very common task in the target demographic
Little work has been done to dock/back-in park a wheelchair in a more general
environment, such a general indoor office environment akin to a room in a
long-term care facility.
