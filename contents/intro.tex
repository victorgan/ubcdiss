% ====================
\section*{PURPOSE}
% ====================
\begin{itemize}
\item (1 page in conference)
\item Describe the problem
\item State your contributions (write the list of contributions fist)
\item that's all
\item use an example to introduce the problem
\item Reader thinks``gosh, if they can really deliver this, that'd be exciting; Iâ€™d better read on" \cite{jones2013how}
\item Contributions should be refutable
\item No "the rest of the paper is". Instead, use forward references from the narrative in the introduction. The introduction (including the contributions) should survey the whole paper, and therefore forward reference every important part
\end{itemize}

(Contributions) In this paper we put this point on a further basis:
\begin{itemize}
\item contribution 1
\end{itemize}

\endinput

Any text after an \endinput is ignored.
You could put scraps here or things in progress.
