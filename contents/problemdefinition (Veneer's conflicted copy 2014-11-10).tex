\chapter{Problem Definition}
% ====================

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Start and stop of tracks
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Occlusions occur when object goes in front of tracked object
		\item tracks can start/stop at edges of frame and when appearing behind a foreground object
	\end{enumerate}
	\item objects move at a certain velocity, 
	\item objects can change scale and rotation
	\item objects are rigid
	\item objects are at the same distance from the camera. Objects aren't necessarily the same colour/texture, but they move in the same tracks
	\item 
\end{enumerate}
