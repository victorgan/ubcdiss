\section*{PURPOSE}
% ====================
\begin{itemize}
\item In a paper you MUST provide the details,
but FIRST convey the idea
\item Introduce the problem, and your idea, using
EXAMPLES and only then present the general case
\item Explain it as if you were speaking to someone using
a whiteboard
\item Conveying the intuition is primary, not secondary
\item Once your reader has the intuition, she can follow
the details (but not vice versa)
\item Even if she skips the details, she still takes away
something valuable
\end{itemize}

Evidence
\begin{itemize}
\item Your introduction makes claims; The body of the paper provides evidence to support each claim
\item Check each claim in the introduction, identify the
evidence, and forward-reference it from the claim
\item Evidence can be: analysis and comparison, theorems,
measurements, case studies
\end{itemize}
