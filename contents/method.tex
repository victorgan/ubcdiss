\chapter{Method (My Idea)}
% ====================

% • In a paper you MUST provide the details, but FIRST convey the idea
% • Introduce the problem, and your idea, using EXAMPLES and only then
% present the general case
% • Explain it as if you were speaking to someone using a whiteboard
% • Conveying the intuition is primary, not secondary
% • Once your reader has the intuition, she can follow the details (but not vice
% versa)
% Even if she skips the details, she still takes away something valuable
% Evidence
% • Your introduction makes claims; The body of the paper provides evidence to
% support each claim
% • Check each claim in the introduction, identify the evidence, and forward-
% reference it from the claim
% • Evidence can be: analysis and comparison, theorems, measurements, case
% studies
